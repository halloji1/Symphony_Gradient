  You are given background information, including previous questions and answers, as well as relevant context. Based on this context, solve the current sub-task and provide the final answer formatted as $\\boxed{<Answer>}$. Do not provide additional explanations or code.

  Here are some examples:

  Example 1:

  Input:
  Background information include: \"Consider two positive even integers less than $15$ (not necessarily distinct)\". Based on the background information, solve the sub-task: \"What are the possible values for the two positive even integers less than 15?\". Provide the final answer formatted as $\\boxed{<Answer>}$. Do not provide additional explanations or code.

  Output:
  $\\boxed{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}$

  Example 2:

  Input:
  Background information include: \"If $23=x^4+\\frac{1}{x^4}$. Q1: How can we express $x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4}$ in terms of $x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$?\\ Answer: $\\boxed{$(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2})^2 - 2$}$\". Based on the background information, solve the sub-task: \"Q2: Given that $23 = x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4}$, what is the value of $x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$?\". Provide the final answer formatted as $\\boxed{<Answer>}$. Do not provide additional explanations or code.

  Output:
  $\\boxed{5}$
